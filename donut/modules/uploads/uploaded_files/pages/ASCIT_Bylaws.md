Nominations for all other elected offices shall open at 8 A.M. on the second Monday of third term shall close at 5 P.M. the following Friday. All nominated candidates shall be listed on a ballot and voted upon at elections to occur the second Monday following the closing of nominations for that office.

SECTION 2. Announcements. The Review Committee Chairman shall publish an announcement in the issue of The California Tech immediately preceding the opening of these nominations. Only nominations for current ASCIT members shall be considered valid. The Review Committee Chairman shall compile a list of candidates and confirm that those candidates accept the nomination. The California Tech and Donut shall publish that complete list of nominated candidates and any statements they wish to make. The Review Committee Chairman shall post nomination sheets, announce nominations, and announce when the election is to be held.

SECTION 3. Voting Procedures. Voting shall be conducted online. Voting will take place from 10:00 A.M. to 11:59P.M. on the day of the election. Absentee ballots shall be allowed in the case of a voter who expects to be absent on the day of an election. Absentee ballots must be filed with the Review Committee Chairman no later than the midnight prior to the election. Voting by proxy is prohibited. All ballots shall be cast secretly.

SECTION 4. Voting Privileges. All registered undergraduates may vote for the Board of Control Chairman, the Board of Control Secretary, the Interhouse Committee Chairman, and the Conduct Review Committee Student Chairman. Only members of the Corporation may vote for other elected officers.

A voter may cast no more than one ballot in each election.

SECTION 5. Ballot Procedures. Each voter shall rank the candidates for each office in order of descending preference, with 1 (first Rank) representing the most preferred. Voters may assign any order to any candidate, including ranking candidates equally. Candidates can only be ranked once. The ballot shall consist of:

(a) The word “NO”,
(b) All legally qualified persons who were i) nominated and ii) accepted their nomination,
(c) A write-in box (write-in candidates must be legally qualified candidates)

Candidates are all ranked last by default. Voters cannot abstain from ranking all candidates, but can leave the ballot in its default state; this is equivalent to abstention. Voters may choose to rank candidates equally.

SECTION 6. Counting Procedures. The Review Committee shall conduct the Count Process as follows:

(a) A Ballot shall be defined as a ranked (numbered), ordering of choices among candidates, expressing preference between candidates. Lower numbers express a greater preference, equal numbers express an equal preference. A ballot shall refer to a voter’s list of preferences among candidates for a particular office, even if voters vote on multiple offices simultaneously (If voters are voting on n offices at once, they are submitting n ballots, one per office).

(b) Ballots may only contain legal candidates. Candidates may only be ranked once. Ballots with improper format or non-legal candidates shall be amended as follows:

i) If a candidate is ranked multiple times, the best ranking shall be kept, and all others shall be removed.

ii) Any non-legal candidates shall be removed from the ballot.

-For the purposes of verification, it is preferred for write-ins to be referred to by their names as they appear on Donut. Revcomm may, at their discretion, account for misspellings, nicknames, and preferred names by allocating rankings to the person they believe was written in on the ballot. There is no guarantee of accuracy here, and should the write-in candidate win with reallocated rankings, a protest shall immediately be filed with Revcomm.

(c) Ballots shall be counted, and a winning candidate shall be decided according to the following procedure, commonly referred to as Ranked Pairs Voting:

i) All pairwise combinations of candidates shall be generated. Each combination, of the form (A, B) shall be assigned a strength, which shall be the number of ballots ranking A better than B.

ii) This list of combinations shall be ordered by strength, with highest strengths first.

1) Ties shall be broken by looking at the inverse pairs. The inverse of (A, B) is (B, A). The pair with the weaker inverse shall be ranked first.

2) In cases of irresolvable ties, all permutations of the tie shall be tested, and if all achieve the same result, that result shall be considered valid. If all do not, a protest shall be automatically filed.

3) A graph shall be constructed by proceeding through the list of pairs. Beginning with the strongest pair of the form (A, B), a directed edge shall be drawn from A to B. This is repeated for all pairs which are stronger than their inverse.

-If drawing this edge would create a cycle, the line is not drawn, and the pair is skipped. A cycle is defined as a non-zero length path that exists from a candidate back to itself.

4) The winner shall be the candidate who is the source for the graph, i.e. the candidate who is the start of all edges.

5) If multiple winners are needed, the winning candidate is declared as a winner and stricken from all ballots, and the process is re-run. This is repeated until all the necessary number of winners has been chosen.

(d) If at any point “NO” wins the election, the remaining positions for the office shall remain vacant and the situation will be addressed according to Article VII Section 10.

SECTION 7. Reporting The Review Committee Chairman must release and post the report of the Review Committee no earlier than 11:59 P.M. on the first day following the election and no later than 10:00 A.M. the second day following the election. This report shall be posted on Donut. Numerical results will not be made public until all officers have been elected. All protests must be given in writing either to the President or the Chairman of the Review Committee. If no protests are received prior to 11:59 P.M. on the first day following the election, the report of the Review Committee will be considered valid and final. Upon receipt of a valid protest, all scheduled elections must be postponed pending resolution of the difficulty. All contested election results shall be withheld until all protests for the respective elections have been resolved.

SECTION 8. Installation of CRC CoChair, IHC Chair, BoC Chair, BoC Secretaries, and Tech Editors will take place at the start of 3rd term.

Installation of all remaining Officers will take place 7th Monday of 3rd term.

An oath of office shall be administered by the retiring President to the incoming President which may take the following form: "I do solemnly swear that I will support the Articles of Incorporation of the Associated Students of the California Institute of Technology, Incorporated, and that I will discharge the duties of the office to which I was elected to the best of my ability."

The President shall administer the oath of his choice to the incoming Board of Directors.


SECTION 9. Retirement All general officers of the Corporation shall retire immediately upon the installation of their respective successors.

SECTION 10. Vacancies. In the event of a vacancy of any elected office due to "NO" winning the election, the Review Committee may appoint an acting officer to fill the office and perform all of its duties, provided that the appointed officer was not a candidate in that election.

In the event of a vacancy of any elected office not due to an election decision, the Review Committee may appoint an acting officer to fill the office and perform all of its duties.

The Review Committee shall convene within two weeks of notification of the vacancy to either appoint an acting officer or defer appointment of an acting officer to a special election. A special election to replace an acting officer may be initiated by a petition of 10% of students allowed to vote for that office. If the vacancy resulted from recall of an elected officer, special election to replace the recalled officer occurs automatically. The Review Committee may choose to defer any acting officer appointment to a new special election. During these special elections, standard election procedures shall be followed with the exception that the nominations will be opened on the Wednesday immediately following the deferral decision of the Review Committee or the presentation of the petition to the Review Committee. An individual may have no more than one vote despite performing the duties of more than one Board of Directors office.

In the event of a vacancy of any appointed position, the body with original appointment power may restart their standard appointment decision process.

If an officer finds that they will be unable to perform their duties for five consecutive weeks for any reason other than studying abroad, they must retire or petition the Review Committee for permission to continue their office. Officers who are studying abroad, with the exception of the ASCIT President, ARC Chair, IHC Chair, BoC Chair, BoC Secretaries and CRC chair, may have temporary replacements appointed by the Review Committee. If the ASCIT President, ARC Chair, IHC Chair, BoC Chair, BoC Secretary or CRC chair chooses to study abroad at some point during their term, they must immediately retire from their position and the vacancy will be filled as normal.

SECTION 11. Appointments. The Corporation Secretary shall announce the availability of any open Board of Director appointed offices and publicly post a nomination sheet. Application periods for the appointed offices shall be opened as soon as possible after the first meeting of each new Board of Directors. Application periods shall remain open at least one week.

The Board of Directors shall interview these applicants for appointed offices. The interviews and appointments shall be closed, but the Board of Directors may invite certain individuals to assist with the interview and the selection.

All appointed positions, regardless of what body has the power to appoint, must have a nomination sheet posted for at least 3 days.

(a) In votes requiring a simple majority, absolute majority shall be defined as half the number of correctly-cast non-abstaining votes. (b) In votes requiring a two-thirds (2/3) majority, absolute majority shall be defined as two-thirds (2/3) of the number of correctly-cast non-abstaining votes.

### ARTICLE VIII--RECALL

Reporting Concerns to the BoC
-----------------------------

This is a guide with advice on how to respond to a BoC concern against you and what to expect throughout the case process. You may also find information in our [Frequently Asked Questions useful.](BoC FAQ)

### Guide for TAs and Professors

1: **Contact the BoC.** Email the BoC Chair and Secretaries (boc at caltech.edu) and tell them that you would like to report a potential violation to the BoC. The BoC will respond to you to arrange a short meeting to discuss the concern and receive copies of the evidence. See ["How do I report a potential violation?"]({{ url_for('committee_sites.FAQ', _anchor='How do I report a potential violation?') }}) for more information.

2: **Copy the evidence.** We recommend that you make two copies of all of the relevant the evidence: one for your own records and one for the BoC.

3: **Meet with the BoC.** Meet with the BoC Chair and one of the Secretaries to discuss the concerns. They will want to collect a copy of the assignment(s) in question and the relevant evidence. They will also ask general questions about the class and more specific questions about your suspicions.

4: **Returning the assignment.** Temporarily grade the assignment as if there were no concern, credit may be removed later through the BoC's nullification decision.

5: **During the case.** You may be contacted at some point for clarification of some issue are some more information about the suspected violation. Otherwise your involvement in the case will be very limited. Contact the BoC Chair and Secretaries if you have any questions or if you want an update on the status of a case.

6: **Decision.** After the case is concluded (you'll probably hear back a few weeks later depending on how busy we are) you will be informed of the conviction and nullification decisions. Please remove credit as indicated and contact the BoC Chair and Secretaries or the Deans if you have any questions, comments, concerns, or want any clarification of the BoC's decision

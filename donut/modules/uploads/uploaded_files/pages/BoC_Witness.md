Depending on the specific nature of the case, your role as a witness can be very frustrating and leave you with little idea of what is going on. This is a guide with general advice on being a witness in a Board of Control case and what to expect throughout the case process. You may also find information in our [Frequently Asked Questions](BoC FAQ) useful.

### Information for a Silent Witness

1: **Provide support.** You're role in this case is to provide help and support for a defendant throughout the case process. Try to make sure that they stay informed and up to date on the case, that they do not get too stressed or overwhelmed by the case, and notify the chair and secretary or the Deans if you have any concerns.

2: **Accompany defendant.** You will likely be asked by the defendant to accompany them to the hearing. Please do accompany them if possible, we will try to schedule the hearing to accommodate you. During the hearing you will sit with the defendant and may speak with them in an aside. You will not be asked any questions or need to speak directly to the BoC.

3: **Decision.** You will likely be asked by the defendant to accompany them to the meeting where the decision is read. As before, please offer the defendant your advice and support.

4: **Confidentiality.** You are expected to maintain absolute secrecy regarding the case to anyone other than the defendant you accompany, the chair and secretary for the case, the Deans, and any member of the counseling center. See ["What confidentiality must I keep?"](FAQ) for more details.

### Information for a BoC Witness

1: **Meeting with the Board.** It is important that you be as honest and accurate as possible, and state whether you remember something clearly, vaguely, or not at all. While the case almost certainly does not depend on your word alone (physical evidence is the number one factor), we do feel that your input will be important to ensure that this case is decided as accurately and fairly as possible. Please see the [Witness FAQ](FAQ) for more information.

2: **Decision.** After the case is concluded you will be informed that "the case has been concluded." You will not be told the details of the case or the decisions of the BoC. Contact the chair and secretary for the case or the Deans if you have any questions, comments, concerns, or want any clarifications.

3: Confidentiality. You are expected to maintain absolute secrecy regarding the case to anyone other than the chair and secretary for the case, the Deans, and any member of the counseling center. See ["What confidentiality must I keep?"](FAQ) for more details.

###**REVCOMM RULINGS**###

2014.1 The Chair of the Review Committee does not get a vote on Review Committee rulings

2014.4 Candidates for office are not allowed to see the results of elections before the results are announced to the public

2014.5 Only the rulings of the review committee regarding the ASCIT bylaws and resolutions need to be published on DONUT and the Little t.

2014.6 Houses can elect multiple ESC reps as long as there is only 1 vote in the ESC per house.

2014.7 The newly elected ascit bod cannot appoint officers until the new ascit bod is installed

2014.8 The at large boc reps shall be appointed before the end of second term by the newly elected (but not necessarily instated) Boc chair and Boc secretaries.

2014.9 Teams of 1 person may run for Tech Editor

2014.10 RevComm meetings in which a vote is not taking place may be held over email.

2015.1 If a tie occurs in an election, a protest is automatically put on file with the review committee

2015.3 The words “In such circumstance that the ASCIT Vice President of Academic Affairs should be incapacitated or otherwise unable to perform the duties of the ASCIT Vice President of Academic Affairs, the ARC Secretary shall serve as the acting ASCIT Vice President of Academic Affairs until such time as the ASCIT Vice President of Academic Affairs returns to duty or an election to fill the vacancy in the office of the ASCIT Vice President of Academic Affairs occurs.” in Article III Section 2 of the ARC Bylaws are in conflict with the ASCIT Bylaws and, as such, are null and void.

2016.1 RevComm meetings in which a vote is taking place may be held over email if the meeting must occur during the midterm or final examination period.

2016.2 The clause in Article VII, Section 10 which states "If an officer for any reason finds he will be unable to perform his duties for five consecutive weeks..." shall be interpreted to mean that the officer must petition immediately after becoming aware that his absence will occur; he may not wait until a later time to address it with the committee.

2016.3 If an officer finds he is unable to complete the duties of office or is removed form his office immediately following an appointment or election (for example, if he becomes ineligible to hold office during the vote-counting period) the votes shall be counted as they would have without the ineligibility, provided he was eligible to hold office at the time of voting. If a vacancy occurs as a result of this, and RevComm appoints an acting officer, RevComm considers the original nominations sign-up sheet from the preceding election to satisfy the requirements of Article VII, Section 11 which requires that all appointed positions have open nominations for at least three days.

2016.4 The Honor Code Handbook and the ASCIT Bylaws are in conflict regarding the composition of the CRC. The Handbook lists two at-large appointed reps, in addition to the co-chair and eight House reps. The Bylaws list the off-campus elected rep in addition to the co-chair and House reps. The two are in conflict; as such, the CRC may include BOTH the off-campus rep and the two at-large appointed reps.


2016.5 Article VII, Section 12 part (a) shall be interpreted to only apply to elections in which one winner is selected. This is based on the wording, "In votes requiring a simple majority", since elections with multiple winners (such as BoC Secretary) must be conducted with a plural majority. This shall be defined as the fraction of votes equal to 1/(n+1) where n is the number of winners to be selected. Thus, in a two-winner election, each candidate must achieve 1/3 of the vote. In other words, each candidate must achieve a number of votes such that no other combination of candidates, write-ins, or "NO" votes can beat that candidate.

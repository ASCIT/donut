# Donut: Official Website of ASCIT

Welcome to the donut-python wiki! This internal (not-so-internal) wiki is intended to document all the services of Donut, so future Devteam members can understand, develop, and maintain  Donut. Our philosophy is to keep Donut **maintainable** and **developable** by future members. It's such a pain as it is now. The technologies used should be simple and universally known (\*cough\* not Perl) now and into the foreseeable future.

Donut elevator pitch: We provide applications and services on behalf of Caltech's undergraduate student body via online services.

The current Donut site (rewritten and released in 2020) can be found at [donut.caltech.edu](https://donut.caltech.edu).
